    % Question 1b
    \item \textit{How many distinct users (username) are there?}\\
    
    Number of distinct usernames: \textbf{499822}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()}, \textit{.distinct()}, and \textit{.count()} on the USERNAME row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1c
    \item \textit{How many distinct countries (country\_name) are there?}\\
    
    Number of distinct country names: \textbf{70}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()}, \textit{.distinct()}, and \textit{.count()} on the COUNTRY\_NAME row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1d
    \item \textit{How many distinct places (place\_name) are there?}\\
    
    Number of distinct place names: \textbf{23121}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()}, \textit{.distinct()}, and \textit{.count()} on the PLACE\_NAME row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1e
    \item \textit{In how many languages users post tweets?}\\
    
    Number of distinct languages: \textbf{46}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()}, \textit{.distinct()}, and \textit{.count()} on the LANGUAGE row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1f
    \item \textit{What is the minimum latitude?}\\
    
    Minimum latitude: \textbf{-54.87555556}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark function \textit{.min()} on the LATITUDE row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1g
    \item \textit{What is the minimum longitude?}\\
    
    Minimum longitude: \textbf{-159.83019441}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark function \textit{.min()} on the LONGITUDE row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1h
    \item \textit{What is the maximum latitude?}\\
    
    Maximum latitude: \textbf{69.83186826}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark function \textit{.max()} on the LATITUDE row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1i
    \item \textit{What is the maximum longitude?}\\
    
    Maximum longitude: \textbf{153.03508445}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark function \textit{.max()} on the LONGITUDE row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1j
    \item \textit{ What is the average length of a tweet text in terms of characters?}\\
    
    Average number of characters in each tweet: \textbf{87.2014098368}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()} and \textit{.mean()} on the length of the TWEET\_TEXT row of the data set.\\ \\
    
    
    % Question 1k
    \item \textit{What is the average length of a tweet text in terms of words?}\\
    
    Average number of words in each tweet: \textbf{12.2284228081}.\\
    
    Solved by using the Spark functions \textit{.map()} and \textit{.mean()} on the split (by empty space) length of the TWEET\_TEXT row of the data set.\\ \\
