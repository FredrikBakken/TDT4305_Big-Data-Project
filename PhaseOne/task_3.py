TASK 3: Geographical Centroids per Country

Description:
 - Find the geographical centroid (latitude-longitude) for each country having more than 10 tweets (>10).
 - Visualize the results in CartoDB (https://carto.com/)
 - Hint: Centroid is the arithmetic mean of latitude and longitude of tweets. Example:
   - Tweet 1 from US with latitude:  33.884 and longitude: -118.092
   - Tweet 2 from US with latitude:  37.782 and longitude: -122.405
   - Tweet 3 from US with latitude:  40.791 and longitude: - 74.019
   - Calculate the average latitude: 37.485 and longitude: -104.838
